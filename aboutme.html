				<h2> Freja Willink</h2>
				<h3>
					<p>
						Hello! 💙My name is Freja Willink, and I'm a junior at UC Berkeley studying Political Economy, with a minor in Journalism. 📘
					</p>
					<p>
						I was born on September 26th, 1999 in Waterbury, CT to John ("Jocko") Willink and Helen Willink. When my Dad was stationed by the Navy in San Diego, CA in 2000, my family moved and we've lived there ever since. It was there they had my three siblings: Rana, (b. 2001), Thor (b. 2002), and Zisa (b. 2009). I was fortunate to grow up near the ocean, always surfing, camping, exploring, and staying active! 🌊
					</p>
					<p>
						In high school I discovered many interests: dancing ballet, working with children, international politics, nutrition, and academia, which led me to UC Berkeley. 🐻Here, I've enjoyed staying active in the arts community and the political arena while pursuing new opportunities and experiences, like Web design! 🦋
